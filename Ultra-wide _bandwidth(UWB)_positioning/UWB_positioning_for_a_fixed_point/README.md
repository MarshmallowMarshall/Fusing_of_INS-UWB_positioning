Description: 
  serial_receive.m is the program to accept data for serial port;

  Get_trajectory_with_MVUfir.m and Get_trajectory_with_MVUfir_4.m are the program files that calculates the position and processes it. The Kalman filter is used for processing.

  (Get_trajectory_with_MVUfir.m is the case that 3 base stations are available; Get_trajectory_with_MVUfir_4.m is the case that 4 base stations are available)

  .txt files are the actual data collected, they are recived by the serial port;

  The other program files are used to draw pictures.
